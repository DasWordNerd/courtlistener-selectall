(questioning whether Fifth Circuit cases should be followed given lack of consensus among federal circuits regarding judicial estoppel).</p>\n    <p id=\"b941-6\">For two related reasons, we agree with Appellees. First, the primary purpose of judicial estoppel is to preserve the integrity of the prior judicial proceeding. <em>See Coastal Plains, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\" index=\"18\" case-ids=\"844432,11662465\">179 F.3d at </extracted-citation>205 &amp; n. 2; <em>Natl.

Thus, it makes sense to apply the law applicable to the prior proceeding.</p>\n    <p id=\"b941-7\">Second, under the similar doctrine of res judicata, the Supreme Court has long held that federal law governs when determining whether a state court claim is barred by a prior federal judgment. <em>John G. &amp; Marie Stella Kenedy Meml. Found. v. Dewhurst, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/90/268/#p287\" index=\"20\" case-ids=\"9317982\">90 S.W.3d 268</extracted-citation>, 287 (Tex.2002); <em>Jeanes v.

This approach operates to preserve the “principle of finality [of judgments].” <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>§ 87 cmt. a. Thus, the Supreme Court’s approach in res judicata eases serves to preserve the integrity of prior federal proceedings.</p>\n    <p id=\"b941-11\">Accordingly, we agree with other Texas courts that the federal law of judicial es-toppel applies in a case in which the prior proceeding was in federal bankruptcy court. We overrule <em>National Loan Investors </em>to the extent it is inconsistent with this approach.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b941-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <p id=\"b941-13\">To prevail on a summary judgment motion, the movant must demonstrate that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Sw.

Once a defendant has presented sufficient evidence to establish a right to summary judgment on an affirmative defense, the burden of production shifts to the nonmovant to present evidence which raises a genuine issue of material fact as to at least one element of the affirmative defense. <em>See Santanna Nat.

Its pursuit of these claims in this post-bankruptcy litigation is clearly inconsistent with the position it took in bankruptcy court. <em>See Coastal Plains, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\" index=\"35\" case-ids=\"844432,11662465\">179 F.3d at 209-10</extracted-citation>; <em>Stewart, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/978/203/\" index=\"36\" case-ids=\"11668471\">978 S.W.2d at 208</extracted-citation>. The fact that Dallas Sales Co. asserted these claims in the adversary proceeding is irrelevant. <em>See Coastal Plains, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\" index=\"37\" case-ids=\"844432,11662465\">179 F.3d at 210</extracted-citation>.</p>\n    <p id=\"b942-6\">Dallas Sales Co. does not dispute that the bankruptcy court accepted its position by authorizing the bankruptcy trustee to abandon the assets of Dallas Sales Co.’s bankruptcy estate because those assets were of “no or little value to the estate.” <em>Cf. Coastal Plains, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\" index=\"38\" case-ids=\"844432,11662465\">179 F.3d at 210</extracted-citation>.</p>\n    <p id=\"b942-7\">Dallas Sales Co. does contend, however, that its failure to disclose these claims in its bankruptcy schedules was inadvertent. To support this argument, Dallas Sales Co. cites the affidavit of its bankruptcy counsel who states that the claims were “inadvertently omitted” because “the principal concern [at the time of the bankruptcy filing] was to obtain post-petition financing.” Notwithstanding this tactical explanation however, it is undisputed that Dallas Sales Co. had knowledge of these claims at a time when it could have amended its schedules to include them because the claims formed the basis of the adversary proceeding it pursued in bankruptcy court. It is also undisputed that Dallas Sales Co. never amended its schedules.</p>\n    <p id=\"b942-9\">According to the Fifth Circuit, “the debtor’s failure to satisfy its statutory disclosure duty is ‘inadvertent’ only when, in general, the debtor either lacks knowledge of the undisclosed claims <em>or </em>has no motive for their concealment.” <em>Coastal Plains, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\" index=\"39\" case-ids=\"844432,11662465\">179 F.3d at 210</extracted-citation>. Counsel’s explanation does not meet this test. Even taking Dallas Sales Co.’s factual allegations as true, Appellees conclusively established that Dallas Sales Co. had knowledge of the undisclosed claims, that it did not list them in its original bankruptcy schedules, and that it did not amend its schedules to include the claims. <em>Cf. Thompson, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/18/701/\" index=\"40\" case-ids=\"11508435\">18 S.W.3d at 704</extracted-citation> (fact issue remained on question of whether debtors’ failure to list personal injury claim in bankruptcy schedule was inadvertent due to debtors’ stated belief that such a claim was not considered a “contingent and unliquidated claim” for bankruptcy purposes).</p>\n    <p id=\"b942-10\">Accordingly, we overrule Dallas Sales Co.’s first point.</p>\n    <p id=\"b942-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n    <p id=\"b942-12\">Because Appellees conclusively established that Dallas Sales Co. is judicially estopped from asserting the claims presented in this lawsuit, we need not address the remainder of the grounds presented in the summary judgment motion or the points challenging them. <em>See Star-Tele</em>\n      <page-number label=\"933\" citation-index=\"1\">*933</page-number>\n      <em>gram, Inc. v.
