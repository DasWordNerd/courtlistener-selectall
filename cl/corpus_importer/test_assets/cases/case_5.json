Upon examination by the appeals referee, Claimant stated that she could take a normal 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. job “if they’re willing to work with me,” but she could not alter her class schedule. She further stated that “I suppose I could miss the class and ... get the work done.”</p>\n    <p id=\"b769-6\">Claimant’s denial of benefits was predicated solely on findings that she was not “available for work” as required by Section 288.040.1(2). In part, the Commission found:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b769-7\">Since the claimant is not a full-time student, no presumption arises that she is per se “not available.” However, during two normal workdays each week the claimant is in class both in the morning and the afternoon for several hours. This would severely restrict her availability for most full-time work.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b769-8\">Additionally, the claimant has been restricting her search for work to days and hours that do not conflict with her schedule. Since the claimant graduates in three weeks, it must reasonably be assumed that finishing her education is her primary goal. Based upon the record as a whole, it is demonstrated that the claimant has been restricting her availability for work and therefore is ineligible for benefits for the period January 29, 2003 through April 26, 2003.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b769-9\">An unemployed claimant is eligible for benefits if she is able to work and is “available” for work. Section 288.040. To be deemed available for work the claimant must have been “actively and earnestly” looking for work. Section 288.040. The expression “available for work” is not defined in Section 288.040.1(2) and it is not necessary nor desirable to attempt an inflexible definition because its meaning will vary depending upon the peculiar facts in each case. <em>Western Elec.

A claimant may render herself unavailable for work, and thus ineligible for unemployment benefits, by imposition of unreasonable restrictions on her accessibility. <em>Scott County Reorganized Sch. Dist. R-6 v. Labor and Indus. Relations Comm’n of Missouri, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/703/528/#p530\" index=\"8\" case-ids=\"9977544\">703 S.W.2d 528</extracted-citation>, 530 (Mo.App. S.D.1985). “A willingness to merely be employed conditionally does not meet the test of availability and the determination of availability for work is largely a question of fact for the commission.” <em>Golden, </em>524 S.W.2d at 38. As stated in <em>Golden:</em>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b770-5\">Ineligible student-claimants are those who limit their availability for work to particular times, days or periods that do not interfere with their primary and principal objective of obtaining a formal education. The reason such students are considered ineligible is that by making themselves available for work only conditionally and on a limited basis at times that do not conflict with their classes and learning purposes, they have divorced themselves actually and currently from the general labor market. While the determination of student-claimants to secure an education is commendable, the standards of the employment security act must be applied consistent with its purpose of removing the economic disabilities and distress resulting from involuntary unemployment.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b770-8\">\n      <em>Id. </em>at 37.</p>\n    <p id=\"b770-9\">Here, the Commission’s decision was based on Claimant’s failure to prove that her primary purpose was employment and not education. While we commend Claimant for her continued efforts to further her education, and note that she did work and attend classes simultaneously prior to her separation from employment, the burden of proof was upon Claimant to prove she was available for work at the time she requested unemployment benefits. The Commission found she was not available and that finishing her education was Claimant’s primary goal. That finding is supported by Claimant’s statements in that even though Claimant insisted repeatedly that the hours were very flexible in her desired field of children’s day care, “[t]he record stands mute as to the extent and existence vel non of any market for labor at the times claimant was willing to accept employment.” <em>See Golden, </em>524 S.W.2d at 38. Claimant argues that in the past she was able to work forty hours a week and carry a similar class schedule and that she had not been told by any <page-number label=\"761\" citation-index=\"1\">*761</page-number>prospective employer that her working and attending classes would be a problem. We agree with the Commission that the issue before this Court is not whether Claimant was available for work at some time in the past. There was sufficient, competent evidence in the record to support the Commission’s decision that Claimant was not available for work at the time she applied for unemployment benefits.</p>\n    <p id=\"b771-5\">Although Claimant’s testimony was un-contradicted, the administrative agency here, as trier of fact, had the right to believe or disbelieve none, all, or part of any witness’ testimony and draw inferences from facts dissimilar to those which a court on judicial review may have drawn. <em>See Tri-State Motor Transit Co. v. Indus. Comm’n of Missouri, </em><extracted-citation url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/509/217/#p220\" index=\"9\" case-ids=\"10119985\">509 S.W.2d 217</extracted-citation>, 220 (Mo.App.1974).

Claimant filed her initial claim for benefits on January 31, 2003. On February 18, 2003, a deputy with the Missouri Division of Employment Security determined that Claimant was ineligible for work under Section 288.040 because her \"school attendance” restricted her availability for work. Claimant filed her Notice of Appeal with the Appeals Tribunal on February 21, 2003. Following a telephone hearing on April 29, 2003, Appeals Referee Honorable Joe Villines, Jr. affirmed the deputy's determination and found Claimant \"was not available for work and therefore is ineligible for benefits.” Claimant then filed an Application for Review with the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission on May 27, 2003.
