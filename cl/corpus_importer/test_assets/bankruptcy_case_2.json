HOMER DRAKE, Jr., Bankruptcy Judge.</author>\n    <p id=\"b49-28\">On October 23, 1979, the above-named debtor filed a petition for relief under Chapter 3 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 301. A trustee for his estate was appointed and on December 10, 1979, the trustee filed a complaint to sell, <em>inter alia, </em>certain equipment, inventory and realty located at 3911 Covington Highway, Decatur, Georgia, known as \u201cJulian\u2019s Tavern.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>complaint also sought to determine what security interest, if any, in the equipment of Julian\u2019s Tavern might be held by either defendant Jack W. Chancey (hereinafter referred to as \u201cChancey\u201d) or defendant First Georgia Bank.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-4\">On that same date this Court ordered all parties in interest to show cause at a hearing on December 20, 1979 why the trustee should not be authorized to sell the above-described property pursuant to his complaint. The Court further ordered the named defendants and each party asserting a claim with respect to the described property to file a statement of such claim by December 17, 1979, to file a motion or answer to the complaint by December 17, 1979, and to file any objections to the sale in writing setting forth the grounds for objection by December 16,1979. The Court also ordered that notice of the hearing be given by mail to all parties in interest including creditors.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-5\">On December 17, 1979, defendant C. J. Hulsey (hereinafter referred to as \u201cHul-sey\u201d) answered the complaint stating that the assets of Julian\u2019s Tavern had been represented by the debtor as having belonged to Janmar, Inc., as indicated by a security agreement attached thereto. Hulsey further claimed a security interest in such assets based upon the attached security agreement and objected to the sale of said property, insisting on abandonment by the trustee to defendant Hulsey in order that his security interest might be foreclosed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-6\">Also on December 17,1979, the defendant First Georgia Bank answered. This defendant claimed a perfected security interest in the inventory and certain listed equipment and prayed that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint to sell the inventory be denied and that the listed equipment be abandoned to it.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-7\">On December 18, 1979, defendant Chan-cey filed his answer showing a security interest in the assets of Julian\u2019s Tavern and praying that his proof of claim be allowed and that his secured interest be reflected upon the Court records.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-8\">On December 20,1979, a pre-trial hearing was held on the complaint and an Order filed the following day. The Order allowed the trustee to abandon the equipment of Julian\u2019s Tavern to the First Georgia Bank and Chancey as their interests appear. The Court also ordered the trustee to sell the inventory and goodwill of Julian\u2019s Tavern to the debtor for the sum of One Thousand Dollars to be paid over the next six months.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-9\">On January 7, 1980, this Court set down the trial on the complaint for January 23, 1980. The trial was held and the Court asked for briefs in support of the various claims of security interests.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-10\">On February 4, 1980, Hulsey filed a brief in support of his alleged security interest in the proceeds of the sale of inventory of Julian\u2019s Tavern.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-11\">On February 6, 1980, the plaintiff filed a supplemental trial brief denying that Hul-sey had any perfected security interest in any property of Julian\u2019s Tavern.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-12\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-13\">1.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-14\">A security interest was signed by Julian Eady, as President of Janmar, Inc., creating in favor of C. J. Hulsey a security interest in the equipment, furnishings and personal property located at Julian\u2019s Tavern.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-15\">2.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-16\">In the security agreement, Eady represented that Janmar, Inc. was the owner of the property which was the subject of the security agreement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-17\">3.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-18\">The signature of the debtor on the security agreement was executed as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b50-19\">\u201cJANMAR, INC.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b50-20\">By: /s/ Julian Eadv. President\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b50-21\">4.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-22\">Janmar, Inc. was never the owner of any property described by the security agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>ment. In fact, Julian Eady was the owner of said property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-5\">5.</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-6\">Hulsey filed a U.C.C. financing statement in DeKalb County, Georgia, the principal place of business of Janmar, Inc.</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-7\">6.</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-8\">The financing statement was indexed under the name Janmar, Inc.</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-9\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-10\">The sole issue is whether the security agreement created in favor of Hulsey was sufficiently perfected to defeat the claim of the trustee in bankruptcy as lien creditor under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(a)(1). An unperfected security interest is subordinate to the rights of a person who becomes a lien creditor, including a trustee in bankruptcy from the date of filing of the petition, before the security interest is perfected. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 109A-9-301. With certain exceptions not applicable here, a financing statement must be filed to perfect all security interests. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 109A-9-302(1); <em>Park Avenue Bank v. Bassford, </em>232 Ga. 216, 205 S.E.2d 861 (1974).</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-11\">\u201cA financing statement is sufficient if it gives the names of the debtor and the secured party, is signed by the debtor, . [and] gives a mailing address of the debt- or.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 109A-9 \u2014 402 (eff. July 1, 1978). The evidence shows that the security agreement was made on December 29,1977 but does not show when the financing statement was filed. However, the Reviser\u2019s Comment to the Georgia Code Annotated states that the only change from prior law is that it \u201cMakes explicit the implicit requirement of the former law that the names of the debtor and the secured party be shown.\u201d Ga.Reviser\u2019s Comment, Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 109A-9-402, p. 379.</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-12\">This raises the question whether the financing statement filed in DeKalb County was sufficient to perfect the security interest where the debtor\u2019s name was incorrect. One commentator has said, \u201c[M]ost of the courts have been willing to tolerate incorrect names and incorrect indexing as effective under \u00a7 9-402(5) when in their judgment the inaccuracies were not \u2018seriously misleading.\u2019 We believe this to be the proper approach and encourage the courts to focus here on whether a reasonably diligent searcher would be likely to discover a financing statement indexed under the incorrect name.\u201d White and Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 23-16, p. 839 (1972).</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-16\">In <em>In re Firth, </em>363 F.Supp. 369 (M.D.Ga.1973), the Court was faced with facts similar to those in this case. There the financing statement bore the name of the debtor as and was indexed under the name of \u201cNational Photocopy Equipment Co.\u201d The debtor\u2019s signature was executed as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b51-17\">\u201cNational Photocopy Equipment Co.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b51-18\">By: /s/ James A. Firth.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b51-19\">In bankruptcy proceeding the allegedly secured creditor sought the return of the assets described by the security agreement, but owned by James A. Firth. The Bankruptcy Judge ruled that the security agreement was unperfected due to an insufficient financing statement and the District Court affirmed. The rationale was that \u201cpersons searching the records would not be put on notice by such a filing.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 371. One Court has cited this case for the proposition that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b51-20\">\u201cThe rule from these and similar cases is that filing under a trade name only is generally defective where the trade name materially differs from the debtor\u2019s real name.\u201d <em>In re Hammons, </em>438 F.Supp. 1143, 1151 (S.D.Miss.1977).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b51-21\">While not going so far as to state a rule of law, this Court finds that the filing of this financing statement was materially defective so as to perfect no security interest against the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-22\">The defendant Hulsey argues that because Eady misrepresented the ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>of the assets at the time of the signing of the security agreement he should be es-topped under Georgia Corporation Law from denying ownership by Janmar, Inc. A similar agreement was offered and found deficient in <em>Firth. </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 106-303, relating to the right of persons to contact under an unregistered trade name, has the effect of binding a sole proprietor who contracts in an unregistered trade name. The Court in <em>Firth </em>found that while this Georgia statute might have the effect of binding those \u201cwho contract in fictitious names to the contract so executed, [it] does not have the effect of saying that financing statements given in fictitious names are sufficient to notify subsequent creditors of the identity of the party using the fictitious name\u201d. 363 F.Supp. at 372.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-4\">Likewise, Georgia Corporation Law may have the effect of personally binding Mr. Eady, but it does not give sufficient notice to subsequent purchasers from Mr. Eady to perfect the security interest.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-5\">Therefore, defendant Hulsey has no secured interest in the proceeds from the sale of the inventory of Julian\u2019s Tavern.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-6\">ORDER</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-7\">It is hereby ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the defendant\u2019s objection to the sale of the . inventory of Julian\u2019s Tavern be denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
