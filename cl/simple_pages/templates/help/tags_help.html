    <h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>
    <p>The tagging feature on CourtListener helps you to tag and organize cases that you are working with.
    </p>
    <p>Currently you are only able to tag dockets, but we plan to add documents and other types of records in the future.</p>
    <p>We hope that if you find our tags useful, you will donate to <a href="https://free.law">Free Law Project</a>, the non-profit supporting CourtListener and RECAP, to support the ongoing development and maintenance of this and other features.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tags-overview">Tags Overview</h3>
    <p>Every tag you create has a page on CourtListener listing items that are labelled with that tag. This allows you to organize and describe our content for your own purposes or to share with others. When you are on one of your tag pages, you can add a description of the tag, and you can make the tag public so that other people can see it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not make a tag page public, nobody else will know you have that tag. Once a tag is made public it is immediately visible to others until you make it private again. All of your public tags will be visible to others as a {% if user.is_authenticated %}<a href="{% url "tag_list" username=user.get_username %}">list of tags in your profile</a>{% else %}list of tags in your profile{% endif %}.
    </p>


    <hr>
    <h3 id="making-tags">Tagging a Docket</h3>
    <p>Tags can be added to any docket by clicking the <a class="btn btn-success btn-sm">Tags <span class="caret"></span></a> button on a docket. Once clicked, a tagging interface will appear:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{% static "png/tag-chooser.png" %}"
         alt="screenshot of the tag chooser"
         class="img-responsive img-rounded shadow center-block"
         height="332"
         width="300">
    </p>
    <p>In that window, you can create new tags by typing in a name and pressing enter. If that tag already exists, it will be checked or unchecked when you press enter. If the tag does not yet exist, it will be created and the docket will be tagged with it. When you're done creating tags, close the tagging tool.</p>


    <hr>
    <h3 id="editing-tags">Editing or Deleting a Tag</h3>
    <p>Tags can be edited or deleted. To edit a tag, either find it on {% if user.is_authenticated %}<a href="{% url "tag_list" username=user.get_username %}">your list of tags</a>{% else %}your list of tags{% endif %} or open it via the <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> icon in the tagging tool.
    </p>
    <p>When editing a tag, you can add a description to it using our editor or you can make it either public or private by toggling the setting in the actions drop down. Public tag pages are immediately visible to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{% static "png/tag-page.png" %}"
           alt="screenshot of the tag page showing edit features"
           class="img-responsive center-block"
           height=729
           width=800>
    </p>
    <p>Tags can be deleted either from the list of tags in your profile page or by using the actions drop down on a tag page, as shown above.
    </p>

    <h3>Coming Soon</h3>
    <p>For now, we only allow tagging dockets, but we hope to add more tags to more parts of CourtListener too.
    </p>
    <p>Please stay tuned!</p>
